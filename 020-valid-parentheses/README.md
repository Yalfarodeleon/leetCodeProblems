## 📝 Problem

> Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1.Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2.Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3.Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.


Example 1:

Input: s = "()"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"

Output: true

Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"

Output: false

Example 4:

Input: s = "([])"

Output: true

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
